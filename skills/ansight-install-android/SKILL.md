description: Install the native Android Ansight SDK with automatic emulator registration and one-shot CLI QR enrollment for physical devices. Add the aggregate dependency, initialize from Application, expose the SDK scanner from a developer-only surface, keep remote tools development-only, verify the Gradle build, and inspect the app through the Ansight CLI.
---

## Cursor plugin integration

Run Ansight CLI commands in Cursor’s terminal on the machine that owns the resident host. A remote workspace or cloud agent does not automatically have access to the developer’s local host. Resolve relative helper paths from this skill’s directory. When this workflow references another bundled skill, read its local SKILL.md completely before following it.

Use these bundled files for the canonical skill URLs referenced below; keep public URLs when writing documentation for the user’s app:

# Ansight Android Install Skill

Use this skill for native Android Kotlin or Java apps.

## Outcome

The finished app must:

- include `ai.ansight:ansight-android` in a local-development build;
- initialize Ansight once from `Application.onCreate()`;
- register automatically on an emulator and expose
  `Ansight.enrollFromQrCode(activity)` from a developer-only UI for physical devices;
- reconnect automatically after the first successful scan;
- keep broad or mutating remote tools out of distributable builds; and
- require no generated JSON, build secret, certificate, or manual app registration.

## Workflow

1. Identify the app module, `Application` class, debug variant, and existing developer menu.
2. Add the aggregate dependency, normally:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    debugImplementation("ai.ansight:ansight-android:1.4.0-preview.1")
}
```

3. Initialize from `Application.onCreate()`:

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
            Ansight.initializeAndActivateDeveloperMode(
                application = this,
                clientName = "Android App",
            )
        }
    }
}
```

4. Add a developer-only action that owns an `Activity`:

```kotlin
Ansight.enrollFromQrCode(activity)
```

5. Do not add a camera permission. The SDK uses Google Code Scanner. The
   aggregate SDK merges ordinary network access and clear-text development
   traffic into the manifest.
6. Keep reflection, secure-storage access, writes, and deletes disabled unless
   the requested development workflow requires them.
7. Create or update `ansight-readme.md` with the scanner location, build
   verification command, and CLI enrollment commands. Do not add an enrollment
   payload or token to it.
8. Run `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` and relevant tests.
9. Start or reuse the resident CLI host. An emulator registers automatically.
   For a physical device, issue one generic host QR and scan it from the
   developer-only surface:

```sh
ansight host run
ansight pairing issue --qr
ansight session list --connected --app-id <app-id> --json
ansight app tools <session-id> --detail summary --include-unavailable --max-results 50 --json
```

   Do not require `ansight app register` before the first connection. After the
   SDK supplies its real App ID, optionally link the discovered app to the
   repository with `ansight app register <app-id> --codebase <repository-path>`.

## Enrollment Behavior

An emulator registers automatically through loopback. For a physical device,
the developer runs `ansight pairing issue --qr` against the resident host and
scans the terminal QR once. The first connection registers the app installation and stores a random
installation id and enrollment state in app-private preferences. Later
developer launches reconnect automatically while the registration remains
active.

If the app already owns a scanner, pass its result through the SDK payload-text
connection API instead of adding a second scanner.

## Recommended Inspection Skills

Use the main router to select the core inspection workflow. Add the native
Android companion only when Android platform semantics are material:
