description: Install Ansight in a .NET MAUI, Android, iOS, or Mac Catalyst app with automatic local CLI-host registration and one-shot QR enrollment for physical devices. Add the all-in-one package, initialize at app startup, expose the SDK scanner from a developer-only surface, keep remote tools development-only, verify target builds, and inspect the app through the Ansight CLI.

## Cursor plugin integration

Run Ansight CLI commands in Cursor’s terminal on the machine that owns the resident host. A remote workspace or cloud agent does not automatically have access to the developer’s local host. Resolve relative helper paths from this skill’s directory. When this workflow references another bundled skill, read its local SKILL.md completely before following it.

Use these bundled files for the canonical skill URLs referenced below; keep public URLs when writing documentation for the user’s app:

# Ansight .NET Install Skill

Use this skill for .NET MAUI, .NET for Android, .NET for iOS, and .NET Mac
Catalyst apps.

## Workflow

1. Identify the app project, target frameworks, startup path, debug guard, and
   existing developer menu.
2. For MAUI, install the all-in-one package:

```shell
dotnet add package Ansight.Maui --prerelease
```

   Then initialize before `builder.Build()`:

```csharp
builder.UseMauiApp<App>();

#if DEBUG
builder.UseAnsight<App>();
#endif
```

   For non-MAUI apps, install `Ansight` and initialize:

```csharp
#if DEBUG
var options = Options.CreateBuilder()
    .WithAnsightSdk()
    .Build();

Runtime.InitializeAndActivate(options);
#endif
```

3. Add a developer-only scanner action:

```csharp
var result = await Runtime.HostConnection.ConnectAsync(
    HostConnectionRequest.QrCode());
```

4. If the app already owns a QR scanner, pass its text through
   `HostConnectionRequest.PayloadText(...)`.
5. Keep all-in-one and broad remote-tool packages in local-development builds.
   Use a protected Release/CI policy for distributable builds.
6. Add only platform privacy declarations needed by the scanner and local
   network flow. Do not add an embedded resource, MSBuild-generated enrollment
   file, certificate, or host address.
7. Create or update `ansight-readme.md` with the scanner location, tool policy,
   build checks, and CLI enrollment commands. Do not include an enrollment payload or token.
8. Run `dotnet build` and relevant tests for every target changed.
9. Start or reuse the resident CLI host. A simulator, emulator, Mac Catalyst,
   or desktop build registers automatically. For a physical device, issue one
   generic host QR and scan it from the developer-only surface:

```sh
ansight host run
ansight pairing issue --qr
ansight session list --connected --app-id <app-id> --json
ansight app tools <session-id> --detail summary --include-unavailable --max-results 50 --json
```

   Do not require `ansight app register` before the first connection. After the
   SDK has supplied its real App ID, optionally link that discovered app to its
   repository with `ansight app register <app-id> --codebase <repository-path>`.

## Enrollment Behavior

Host-local targets register through automatic loopback and do not need a scan.
The first physical-device scan registers the installation and stores a random installation id
and enrollment state in app-private storage. `HostConnectionRequest.Auto()` and
normal host auto-probe reconnect it on later developer launches.

## Recommended Inspection Skills

Use the main router to select the core inspection workflow. Add the .NET
companion only when MAUI or .NET-specific semantics are material:
