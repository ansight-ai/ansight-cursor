description: Add Flutter widget and native-platform semantics to an Ansight operation. Use alongside a selected core Ansight workflow when widget hierarchy, navigation, native rendering, physical-device logging, or Flutter tool behavior affects interpretation; do not use as the primary live-operation, remote-tool, session-investigation, or annotation workflow.
---

## Cursor plugin integration

Run Ansight CLI commands in Cursor’s terminal on the machine that owns the resident host. A remote workspace or cloud agent does not automatically have access to the developer’s local host. Resolve relative helper paths from this skill’s directory. When this workflow references another bundled skill, read its local SKILL.md completely before following it.

Use these bundled files for the canonical skill URLs referenced below; keep public URLs when writing documentation for the user’s app:

# Ansight Flutter Inspection Semantics

Use this companion skill for Flutter apps targeting iOS or Android. Do not route a native-only app here merely because generated Flutter platform folders are present elsewhere in the repository.

## Keep The Core Workflow In Charge

Select the skill that owns the requested outcome before applying these Flutter semantics:

- live lifecycle or visible UI interaction: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-operate-live-app/SKILL.md`
- bundled or app-specific remote tools: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-use-remote-app-tools/SKILL.md`
- live or recorded evidence investigation: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-investigate-session/SKILL.md`
- annotation writes: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-annotate-session/SKILL.md`

The selected core skill owns session selection, authorization, command procedure, verification, reporting, and any relevant workspace reuse. Use this skill only to interpret Flutter-specific evidence or choose among cataloged Flutter and native tool families.

## Interpret Flutter Evidence

- Use cataloged `flutter.get_widget_tree`, `flutter.inspect_widget`, `flutter.find_widgets`, or `flutter.get_navigation_state` only when widget ownership, Flutter layout, widget state, or navigation semantics are material.
- Use cataloged native `ui.*` tools for UIKit or Android hierarchy, screenshots, platform views, overlays, and native rendering or hit-testing issues.
- Treat Flutter widget IDs, native nodes, automation IDs, and reflection roots as separate namespaces unless a returned schema explicitly connects them.
- Compare widget and native evidence when diagnosing a mismatch between Flutter state and rendered platform UI.
- Treat Flutter, native, storage, artifact, and `reflect.*` families as optional catalog entries, and treat any Flutter action tool as a remote mutation.

## Physical Device And Fallback Semantics

A paired physical build can stream app-provided logs, Ansight diagnostics, telemetry, screenshots, touches, and tool results. Use Xcode device logging or Android system logs only when complete OS or process output not captured by the app is required.

Use Flutter tooling, Xcode, ADB, simulator or emulator tools, device logs, or source inspection only after the owning core skill identifies a concrete Ansight capability gap. Report the gap and exact fallback.

## Report Flutter-Specific Evidence

In addition to the core skill's report, name the Flutter target platform, distinguish widget-tree evidence from native hierarchy evidence, and identify any Flutter tool or platform fallback used.
