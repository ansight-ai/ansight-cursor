description: Route an ambiguous Ansight app request to the narrowest live-operation, remote-tool, session-investigation, annotation, readiness-audit, workspace-automation, or platform-inspection skill. Use only when the request does not already identify the required Ansight workflow.

## Cursor plugin integration

Run Ansight CLI commands in Cursor’s terminal on the machine that owns the resident host. A remote workspace or cloud agent does not automatically have access to the developer’s local host. Resolve relative helper paths from this skill’s directory. When this workflow references another bundled skill, read its local SKILL.md completely before following it.

Use these bundled files for the canonical skill URLs referenced below; keep public URLs when writing documentation for the user’s app:

# Ansight App Inspection Router Skill

Use this skill to choose a workflow, not to perform one. Once a specialist is selected, load it completely, stop following this router, and do not route back here from that specialist.

## Goal

Select one primary skill that owns the requested outcome. Add another skill only when the request crosses a real capability boundary.

## Choose The Primary Skill

| Request | Use this skill |
| --- | --- |
| Start or reuse the host, boot a target, launch or stop an app, resolve a live session, use tree-first interactive actions/batches with screenshot fallback, and verify | Installed `/ansight-operate-live-app`; fallback: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-operate-live-app/SKILL.md` |
| Discover and call bundled or app-specific tools exposed by a connected app | Installed `/ansight-use-remote-app-tools`; fallback: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-use-remote-app-tools/SKILL.md` |
| Inspect a live or recorded session, correlate telemetry and other evidence, or create a non-destructive session slice | Installed `/ansight-investigate-session`; fallback: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-investigate-session/SKILL.md` |
| Add or update a timeline annotation, screenshot geometry, or visual-tree target | Installed `/ansight-annotate-session`; fallback: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-annotate-session/SKILL.md` |
| Score integration strength or automation readiness and produce a remediation plan | Installed `/ansight-assess-automation-readiness`; fallback: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-assess-automation-readiness/SKILL.md` |
| Create or maintain tests, tasks, triggers, Trends definitions, sanitizers, schemas, or workspace registration | Installed `/ansight-ui-testing`; fallback: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/agents/ansight-ui-testing/SKILL.md` |
| Prepare the CLI, resident host, or workstation dependencies | Installed `/ansight-cli-setup`; fallback: `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/ansight-cli-setup.md` |

This table selects ownership, not a sequence. The chosen specialist owns its prerequisite checks, authorization boundaries, commands, verification, and reporting.

## Combine Skills Sparingly

- Pair live operation with remote tools only when the request needs both visible UI behavior and in-process state or operations.
- Pair a core evidence skill with one platform inspection skill only when framework internals, platform logging, reflection suites, or platform-specific tool semantics matter.
- Pair investigation with annotation only when the user asks both to analyze evidence and to write review metadata. Reading an annotation does not require the annotation skill.
- A readiness audit may use live operation, remote tools, investigation, or a platform skill as evidence helpers, but the readiness skill remains the owner of scoring and reporting. Load those helpers directly; never reload this router.
- Workspace authoring does not require live-operation or investigation skills unless the user also requests execution or runtime verification.

## Platform Inspection Skills

| App shape | Use this skill |
| --- | --- |
| .NET MAUI, .NET for Android, .NET for iOS, .NET Mac Catalyst | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/dotnet/ansight-app-inspection-dotnet.md` |
| Native iOS SwiftUI or UIKit | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/ios/ansight-app-inspection-ios.md` |
| Native Android Kotlin or Java | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/android/ansight-app-inspection-android.md` |
| React Native or Expo development build with iOS and Android native projects | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/react-native/ansight-app-inspection-react-native.md` |
| Flutter with Android and/or iOS targets | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/flutter/ansight-app-inspection-flutter.md` |
| Cordova-family or Ionic app built with Capacitor 8 | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/cordova/ansight-app-inspection-cordova.md` |

If more than one app or platform is present, ask which running app/session should be inspected unless the user supplied an explicit app id, session id, device, or app name.

## Detection Hints

Inspect the repo, `ansight app list --json`, and focused `ansight app tools
<session-id> --query <terms> --detail summary --json` results before choosing.
Do not load an unfiltered full tool catalog merely to identify a platform:

- `.csproj`, `MauiProgram.cs`, `TargetFramework` values such as `net*-android`, `net*-ios`, or `net*-maccatalyst`: use the .NET inspection skill.
- `.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift`, `Podfile`, `Info.plist`, SwiftUI `App`, or UIKit `AppDelegate` without React Native app files: use the native iOS inspection skill.
- `settings.gradle`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, and Kotlin or Java `Application` without React Native app files: use the native Android inspection skill.
- `package.json` with `react-native` or `expo`, generated `ios/` and `android/` projects, `metro.config.*`, or `@react-native/*`: use the React Native inspection skill.
- `pubspec.yaml` with Flutter, `lib/main.dart`, and Flutter target folders: use the Flutter inspection skill.
- `package.json` with `@capacitor/core`, `capacitor.config.*`, and native target folders: use the Cordova / Capacitor inspection skill.

React Native and Expo, Flutter, and Capacitor take precedence over their generated native target folders. Expo Go cannot load the native bridge; only route Expo development builds. A .NET MAUI app takes precedence over its `Platforms/iOS` and `Platforms/Android` folders.

When source-code clues are unavailable, use the Ansight app/session metadata and remote app tool catalog:

- MAUI or `.NET` names, `maui.*` tools, or .NET package metadata: .NET.
- React tool ids such as `react.get_component_tree` or `react.get_shadow_tree`: React Native.
- Flutter tool ids such as `flutter.get_widget_tree` or `flutter.find_widgets`: Flutter.
- DOM tool ids such as `dom.get_document` with adapter metadata `@ansight/capacitor`: Cordova / Capacitor.
- Native iOS bundle ids, UIKit visual-tree metadata, or Swift package names: native iOS.
- Android package ids, Android view hierarchy metadata, or Gradle module names: native Android.
- `reflect.*` tool ids indicate a platform reflection suite is installed; route by app/session metadata and neighboring platform tool families before using reflection.

## Route And Stop

1. Classify the requested outcome and select one primary skill from the table.
2. Inspect repository markers only when a platform skill may be required.
3. Add at most the directly needed platform or evidence helper skills.
4. Report missing prerequisites. Route to CLI setup or SDK installation only when setup or installation is already within the requested scope.
5. Stop following this router and continue with the selected skill or deliberate combination.

If platform detection remains ambiguous, generic evidence skills can still work with standard Ansight surfaces. Ask the user to choose a platform only before a platform-specific operation would materially change the workflow.
