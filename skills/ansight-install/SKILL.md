description: Use this skill when installing or configuring Ansight but the app platform has not been selected yet. Install the Ansight CLI with the official platform script when needed, run ansight doctor to identify environment dependencies, obtain approval before installing missing tools, route to the matching platform-specific SDK skill, and finish with CLI enrollment and structured session verification.

## Cursor plugin integration

Run Ansight CLI commands in Cursor’s terminal on the machine that owns the resident host. A remote workspace or cloud agent does not automatically have access to the developer’s local host. Resolve relative helper paths from this skill’s directory. When this workflow references another bundled skill, read its local SKILL.md completely before following it.

Use these bundled files for the canonical skill URLs referenced below; keep public URLs when writing documentation for the user’s app:

# Ansight Install Router Skill

Use this skill when the user asks an agent to install or configure Ansight and the prompt does not already name the target SDK.

This is a routing skill. Do not perform a full SDK integration from this file. Identify the app platform, then fork into or load the matching platform-specific install skill and follow that skill as the source of truth.

## CLI Prerequisite

Treat the official website installers as the only supported CLI bootstrap. Do
not reconstruct their download, checksum, PATH, skill, account, or resident-host
steps manually.

1. Detect the current operating system and whether `ansight` resolves on PATH.
2. If the CLI is missing, show the matching command and ask the user to approve
   running it. If the agent is authorized to install developer tooling, run the
   approved command directly; otherwise ask the user to run it and wait for the
   result.

   macOS or Linux:

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://www.ansight.ai/install.sh | bash
   ```

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   irm https://www.ansight.ai/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

3. Open a new shell if PATH changes are not visible, then verify the installed
   CLI rather than assuming installation succeeded:

   ```sh
   ansight version --json
   ansight doctor --json
   ```

The scripts are published with the website at
`https://www.ansight.ai/install.sh` and
`https://www.ansight.ai/install.ps1`.

## Doctor-Led Dependency Setup

Use `ansight doctor --json` as the source of truth for the current machine.
Do not guess dependencies from the app platform alone.

- Explain every required failure and every optional capability that affects the
  requested workflow.
- Before using Homebrew, apt, dnf, winget, dotnet tool installation, npm, or any
  other package manager, show the exact packages and commands and ask the user
  to approve installing them.
- Do not install an optional dependency merely because Doctor reports it as
  missing. Ask whether the user wants the feature it enables.
- After approved dependency changes, rerun `ansight doctor --json` and report
  what changed. Do not claim the workstation is ready while a required check is
  still failing.
- Use `https://www.ansight.ai/docs/cli/dependencies` for the platform-specific
  installation commands and the feature enabled by each dependency.

## Routing Rules

Inspect the repo before choosing:

- Use the .NET install skill for .NET MAUI, .NET for Android, .NET for iOS, and .NET Mac Catalyst apps.
- Use the iOS install skill for native SwiftUI or UIKit apps.
- Use the Android install skill for native Android Kotlin apps.
- Use the React Native install skill for React Native apps and Expo development builds with generated iOS and Android native projects.
- Use the Flutter install skill for Flutter apps with Android and/or iOS targets.
- Use the Cordova / Capacitor install skill for Cordova-family or Ionic apps built with Capacitor 8.

If more than one app is present, ask which app should be configured unless the user's prompt clearly identifies one.

## Remote Tool Default

When the selected install enables reflection, mention the concrete `reflect.*` tool family and default the reflection package or suite to a development-time dependency: Debug or explicit local-development variants only, with runtime guards. Do not enable `reflect.*` for distributable builds unless the user explicitly requests it and accepts the policy.

## Platform Skills

| Platform | Use This Skill |
| --- | --- |
| .NET MAUI, .NET Android, .NET iOS, .NET Mac Catalyst | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/dotnet/ansight-install-dotnet.md` |
| Native iOS SwiftUI or UIKit | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/ios/ansight-install-ios.md` |
| Native Android Kotlin | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/android/ansight-install-android.md` |
| React Native / Expo development build | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/react-native/ansight-install-react-native.md` |
| Flutter | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/flutter/ansight-install-flutter.md` |
| Cordova / Capacitor | `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/cordova/ansight-install-cordova.md` |

## Detection Hints

- `.csproj`, `MauiProgram.cs`, `TargetFramework` values such as `net*-android`, `net*-ios`, or `net*-maccatalyst`: .NET.
- `.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift`, `Podfile`, `Info.plist`, SwiftUI `App`, or UIKit `AppDelegate` without React Native app files: native iOS.
- `settings.gradle`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, and Kotlin `Application` without React Native app files: native Android.
- `package.json` with `react-native` or `expo`, generated `ios/` and `android/` projects, `metro.config.*`, or `@react-native/*`: React Native / Expo development build.
- `pubspec.yaml` with a Flutter SDK dependency, `lib/main.dart`, and Flutter `android/` or `ios/` targets: Flutter.
- `package.json` with `@capacitor/core`, `capacitor.config.*`, and native `android/` or `ios/` projects: Cordova / Capacitor.

React Native and Expo, Flutter, and Capacitor take precedence over the native iOS or Android project folders they contain. Expo Go cannot load the native Ansight bridge; route only Expo development builds with generated native projects. If a classic Apache Cordova app does not use Capacitor 8, report that the current `@ansight/capacitor` adapter is not a drop-in target.

## Workflow

1. Install and verify the CLI through the [CLI prerequisite](#cli-prerequisite).
2. Run the [Doctor-led dependency setup](#doctor-led-dependency-setup), obtaining approval before installing missing tools.
3. Inspect the repository root and likely app directories.
4. Identify the target platform and app module.
5. If the current agent supports subagents or thread forking, fork the implementation into the matching platform-specific skill.
6. If the current agent cannot fork, load or follow the matching platform-specific skill directly in the current task.
7. Continue with the selected skill's workflow, including automatic host-local registration, one-shot physical-device QR enrollment, runtime guards, minimal platform privacy declarations, verification, and `ansight-readme.md`.
8. Use the Ansight CLI for host status, generic physical-device QR enrollment, connected-session discovery, optional post-discovery app-to-codebase registration, and tool verification. If CLI setup needs more detail, load `https://www.ansight.ai/skills/ansight-cli-setup.md`.
9. Include the selected skill URL in the final response so the user can audit which route was used.

Do not claim a platform-specific setup was completed until the selected skill's verification steps have actually passed or the remaining manual steps are listed.
