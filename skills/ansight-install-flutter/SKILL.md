description: Install ansight_flutter with automatic simulator or emulator registration and one-shot CLI QR enrollment for physical devices. Add the package, initialize the runtime and instrumentation, expose enrollFromQrCode from a developer-only surface, configure required native privacy declarations, verify Flutter and native builds, and inspect the app through the Ansight CLI.

## Cursor plugin integration

Run Ansight CLI commands in Cursor’s terminal on the machine that owns the resident host. A remote workspace or cloud agent does not automatically have access to the developer’s local host. Resolve relative helper paths from this skill’s directory. When this workflow references another bundled skill, read its local SKILL.md completely before following it.

Use these bundled files for the canonical skill URLs referenced below; keep public URLs when writing documentation for the user’s app:

# Ansight Flutter Install Skill

Use this skill for Flutter apps with Android and/or iOS targets.

## Workflow

1. Inspect `pubspec.yaml`, `main.dart`, target platforms, debug guard, and
   existing developer menu.
2. Add `ansight_flutter: 1.4.0-preview.1` and run `flutter pub get`.
3. Initialize after `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` and before
   `runApp(...)`:

```dart
if (kDebugMode) {
  await Ansight.instance.initializeAndActivate(AnsightOptions.developer());
  await AnsightFlutterInstrumentation.instance.install();
}
```

4. Add a developer-only scanner action:

```dart
await Ansight.instance.enrollFromQrCode(
  clientName: 'My Flutter App',
);
```

5. `scanPairingQrCode(...)` is an API alias. Use the payload connection API
   when the app already owns a scanner.
6. Keep widget and native tools behind `kDebugMode` or an equivalent explicit
   developer variant. Prefer read-only access.
7. Android requires no app camera permission for the SDK scanner. On iOS, add
   `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`. Add no ATS
   exception or unrelated permissions.
8. Create or update `ansight-readme.md` with the scanner location, tool profile,
   build checks, and CLI enrollment commands. Do not include an enrollment payload.
9. Run `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and practical target builds.
10. Start or reuse the resident CLI host. A simulator or emulator registers
    automatically. For a physical device, issue one generic host QR and scan it
    from the developer-only surface:

```sh
ansight host run
ansight pairing issue --qr
ansight session list --connected --app-id <app-id> --json
ansight app tools <session-id> --detail summary --include-unavailable --max-results 50 --json
```

    Do not require `ansight app register` before the first connection. After
    the SDK supplies its real App ID, optionally link the discovered app to the
    repository with `ansight app register <app-id> --codebase <repository-path>`.

Simulator and emulator builds register automatically through native loopback.
The first physical-device scan registers the native app installation. Its random installation
id and enrollment state remain in app-private storage, so later developer
launches reconnect automatically.

## Recommended Inspection Skills

Use the main router to select the core inspection workflow. Add the Flutter
companion only when widget or native-platform semantics are material:
